# Environment specific configuration for Unitree Go1
env_name: "Go1MujocoCustom-v0" # Custom env ID if registered, or a descriptive name
task: "Make the Go1 robot walk forward at a desired velocity."
task_description: "The agent controls a Unitree Go1 quadruped robot simulated in MuJoCo. The goal is to track a desired linear (forward) and angular velocity. Observations include joint positions/velocities, base linear/angular velocities, projected gravity vector, desired velocity, and previous actions. Actions are joint torques."
