Feedback from Previous Iterations:
This is the first iteration. Please generate an initial reward function based on the task description.

Using the above information, please generate a refined reward function in Python. Ensure that the code is modular and includes clear comments explaining the purpose and rationale behind each section. The reward function should be suitable for guiding a reinforcement learning agent to successfully complete the described task in the specified environment.

```

**LLM Response:**
```
Here is a Python code that defines a reward function for a robotics task.

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
    """
    Custom reward function for Ralph the Robotic arm.

    The function will compute the Euclidean distance between the current end-effector's position 
    and the desired goal's position and then it will return the negative of that distance as a reward.
    Subgoals' reward will depend on their appropriate achieving. 
    A potential can be added, it will reflect the bounded reward as the policy's performance gets better, 
    so it will incentive the robotic arm to improve its reaching manner.

    Parameters:

    obs: dict
        A dictionary that contains observation array which state and desired goal, achieved goal position are included.
    action: ndarray
        An action that should be taken based on the `obs` which is provided as the 4D torque command to the robot.
    done: bool
        A boolean flag that indicates whether or not the episode is terminated.
    env: str
        The specific environment that the function is used for. It's helpful for debugging.

    Output:

    reward: float
        A single float standing for the reward in the environment at current point.

    """
    # unwrap the environment to have access to the base environment
    env = env.unwrapped

    # if the observation is a dictionary, extract the actual observation array
    obs = obs.get('observation', obs)

    # calculate the goal distance 
    goal_distance = np.linalg.norm(env.goal - obs['achieved_goal'])

    # specify the reward function for the task
    # we'll give a negative reward proportional to the distance from the goal position
    # this will incentivize the robotic arm to minimize the distance to the goal
    reward = -goal_distance

    # add a bonus reward for successfully reaching the goal position
    # this should encourage the arm to not just get close to the goal, but to accurately reach it
    if goal_distance < 0.05:
        reward += 0.1

    # penalize the robotic arm for using high magnitude actions
    # this will incentivize the arm to reach the goal efficiently, using the smallest possible actions
    action_magnitude = np.linalg.norm(action)
    reward -= 0.01 * action_magnitude

    return reward
```
The specifics of the provided reward can be tailered according to the specific task, the used values are hypothetical and are used for demonstration purposes only.

Please carefully analyze the following policy feedback and reward function components. Based on this analysis, provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task.

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
(1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function. (Note: Success rate info might not be explicitly available, use Average Evaluation Reward as a proxy).
(2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout (Note: Component-wise breakdown is not provided, infer from code structure and overall results), then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider:
    (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter,
    (b) Re-writing the reward component, or
    (c) Discarding the reward component.
(3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range.

Please analyze the existing reward function code in the suggested manner above first, considering the provided results (Average Eval Reward, Final Training Reward, Error messages if any). Then write the new reward function code.

The reward function must have the signature:
    def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
Use only NumPy and standard Python, and access the target position using env.unwrapped.goal.
