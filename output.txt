To create a reward function for a quadruped robot dog tasked with walking to a target position, we can consider variables such as the robot's current position, the target position, and its orientation. The reward should encourage the robot to minimize the distance to the target and possibly maintain a stable orientation. Here's a potential reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(
    robot_pos: torch.Tensor, 
    target_pos: torch.Tensor
) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:

    # Compute the distance to the target position
    distance_to_target = torch.norm(target_pos - robot_pos, p=2, dim=-1)

    # Reward component for minimizing the distance to the target
    reward_distance = -distance_to_target

    # Temperature parameter for transforming the distance reward
    temperature_distance = 1.0
    transformed_reward_distance = torch.exp(reward_distance / temperature_distance)

    # Total reward is primarily based on the transformed distance reward
    total_reward = transformed_reward_distance

    # Compile the components into a dictionary for diagnostics
    reward_dict = {
        "reward_distance": transformed_reward_distance,
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

In this reward function:
- `robot_pos` is the current position of the robot and `target_pos` is the position of the target.
- We calculate the Euclidean distance between the robot's current position and the target.
- We generate a reward component that negatively correlates with distance to encourage the robot to get closer to the target.
- We apply a temperature-scaled `torch.exp` transformation to ensure that the reward doesn't grow without bounds as the robot gets closer to the target. The transformation helps in normalizing the reward.
- The `reward_dict` contains the transformed distance reward component for monitoring and analysis.

You may choose to adjust the temperature parameter (`temperature_distance`) based on the specifics of your training environment to better tune the learning process.
