This reward function focuses on:
- **Distance**: Encourages the robot to minimize the distance to the target position.
- **Velocity**: Rewards movement towards the target with positive velocity.
- **Stability**: Penalizes deviations in velocity to encourage stable walking.

Each component is transformed using torch.exp to normalize the reward values within a range, with specific temperature parameters tailored for each component. This transformation ensures that the reward function remains effective across different scales of measurement.
