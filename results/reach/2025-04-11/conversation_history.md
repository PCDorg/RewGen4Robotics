    ----------
    obs : a dictionary or array like
        Current observation of the environment. If it's a dictionary, it must include an "observation" key.

    action : array like

Please carefully analyze the following policy feedback and reward function components. Based on this analysis, provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task.

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
(1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function. (Note: Success rate info might not be explicitly available, use Average Evaluation Reward as a proxy).
(2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout (Note: Component-wise breakdown is not provided, infer from code structure and overall results), then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider:
    (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter,
    (b) Re-writing the reward component, or
    (c) Discarding the reward component.
(3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range.

Please analyze the existing reward function code in the suggested manner above first, considering the provided results (Average Eval Reward, Final Training Reward, Error messages if any). Then write the new reward function code.

The reward function must have the signature:

**LLM Response:**
```
Based on the provided feedback, it seems that the evaluation of the model failed. This may be due to some potential issue in the reward function or it may be due to an issue in the reinforcement learning algorithm setup. However, since our task is to review and refine the reward function, we'll focus on that.

While analyzing the previous reward function, we see that it's considering only the euclidean distance from the current position to the goal position to calculate the reward. Considering more factors in the reward function may help RL agent to learn more effectively, like action taken by agent.

Below is the refined reward function:

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
    """
    Custom reward function for the robotics manipulation task. In this task, a robot arm
    must reach a specific goal position as quickly and accurately as possible. The reward is
    a negative function of the distance to the goal and takes into consideration the action taken
    by the agent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : a dictionary or array like
        Current observation of the environment. If it's a dictionary, it must include an "observation" key.

    action : array like
        The last action taken by the agent.

    done : Boolean
        Whether the task is done or not.

    env : gym.Env
        The environment where the agent is interacting.

    Returns
    -------
    reward : a single float value
        The reward for the current state, action, and next state.
    """
    # Fetch the unwrapped environment
    base_env = env.unwrapped

    # Parse observation depending on if it is array-like or dictionary
    obs = obs.get('observation', obs) if isinstance(obs, dict) else obs

    # environment specific constants
    ctrl_cost_weight = 1e-4
    goal = base_env.goal

    # Compute the euclidean distance between the current state and the goal
    dist_to_goal = np.linalg.norm(goal - obs[:3])

    # Control cost
    ctrl_cost = ctrl_cost_weight * np.square(action).sum()

    # Reward is as per the OpenAI 'FetchReach-v1' environment:
    # Reward is comprised of a distance reward and a control cost
    reward = -dist_to_goal - ctrl_cost

    return reward

```

Now, the reward function not just considers the distance to the goal but also considers the action taken by the agent. We added a control cost term in the reward function which will penalize the agent for taking larger values of actions. The more "aggressive" the actions, the larger their squares are, leading to a larger penalty. This should incentivize the agent to reach the goal with smaller, more precise movements. This is one common approach to smoothing the learning process for the agent. It's also closely mimics the reward function of the OpenAI 'FetchReach-v1' environment.

**LLM Response:**

## Revised Reward Function Code

Let's revise our custom reward function for the fetchreach task. 

The previous reward is reliant mainly on the Euclidean distance from the agent's position to the goal and includes a control cost for actions. While these components are essential, it could be beneficial to revise the weighing between these two components. The control cost seems to have a negligible impact on the overall reward due to its small weight (1e-4). 

To refine the task to reach success more quickly, we can think of increasing the weight of the control cost. If the agent takes too many steps or moves too much, the cumulative control cost should be high, incentivizing the agent to reach the goal quicker and with more precise movements. 

Additionally, to avoid negative rewards, we can contain our rewards within the [0, 1] range by squaring the distance to the goal and then subtracting it from 1. Hence, the total reward will be 1 - normalized distance to goal - control cost.

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
    """
    Custom reward function for the robotics manipulation task. In this task, a robot arm
    must reach a specific goal position as quickly and accurately as possible. The reward is
    a function of the distance to the goal and takes into consideration the action taken
    by the agent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : a dictionary or array like
        Current observation of the environment. If it's a dictionary, it must include an "observation" key.

    action : array like
        The last action taken by the agent.

    done : Boolean
        Whether the task is done or not.

    env : gym.Env
        The environment where the agent is interacting.

    Returns
    -------
    reward : a single float value
        The reward for the current state, action, and next state.
    """
    # Fetch the unwrapped environment
    base_env = env.unwrapped

    # Parse observation depending on if it is array-like or dictionary
    obs = obs.get('observation', obs) if isinstance(obs, dict) else obs

    # Environment specific constants
    ctrl_cost_weight = 1e-3     # Increase control weight to incentivize agent to take fewer, more precise moves
    goal = base_env.goal

    # Compute the normalized euclidean distance between the current state and the goal and square it
    dist_to_goal = np.square(np.linalg.norm(goal - obs[:3]))

    # Control cost
    ctrl_cost = ctrl_cost_weight * np.square(action).sum()

    # Reward is now a function of normalized distance reward and a control cost
    reward = 1 - dist_to_goal - ctrl_cost

    return reward
```

This reward function should encourage the agent to reach its goal more efficiently by incentivizing efficiency in actions taken. 

However, it's critical to remember that reinforcement learning involves a lot of experimentation, so it's essential to observe the agent's performance and adjust the reward function accordingly.

Please carefully analyze the following policy feedback and reward function components. Based on this analysis, provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task.

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
(1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function. (Note: Success rate info might not be explicitly available, use Average Evaluation Reward as a proxy).
(2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout (Note: Component-wise breakdown is not provided, infer from code structure and overall results), then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider:
    (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter,
    (b) Re-writing the reward component, or
    (c) Discarding the reward component.
(3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range.

Please analyze the existing reward function code in the suggested manner above first, considering the provided results (Average Eval Reward, Final Training Reward, Error messages if any). Then write the new reward function code.

```

**LLM Response:**
```
The previous reward function calculates the reward primarily based on the distance between the robot and the target (dist_to_goal). The function also considers the control cost, penalizing extensive use of action inputs.

A possible issue with the previous function is that the dist_to_goal term could dominate the reward calculation, effectively reducing the impact of the control cost term. This might result in an agent that aggressively moves toward the goal, but wastes energy on unnecessary or inefficient movements, due to the control cost term not sufficiently affecting the overall reward.

Here is a refined version of the reward function:

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
    """
    Custom reward function for the FetchReach robotics manipulation task. The reward is
    primarily based on the euclidean distance to the goal. Furthermore, to promote efficiency,
    the agent is penalized proportional to the sum of the squared action inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : a dictionary or array like
        Current observation of the environment. If it's a dictionary, it needs to include an "observation" key.

    action : array like
        The agent's last action.

    done : Boolean
        Indicates whether the task is done or not.

    env : gym.Env
        The environment where the agent is interacting.

    Returns
    -------
    reward : float
        The reward for the current state, action, and next state.
    """
    # Fetch the unwrapped environment
    base_env = env.unwrapped

    # Parse observation
    obs = obs.get('observation', obs) if isinstance(obs, dict) else obs

    # Constants
    ctrl_cost_weight = 0.1   # Increased the weight to discourage sway actions.
    goal = base_env.goal

    # Compute the euclidean distance between the current position and the goal and square it
    dist_to_goal = np.square(np.linalg.norm(goal - obs[:3]))

    # Control cost (penalize extensive action inputs to encourage efficiency)
    ctrl_cost = ctrl_cost_weight * np.square(action).sum()

    # The reward is the inverse of the distance to the goal, but also considering the control cost
    reward = - dist_to_goal - ctrl_cost

    return reward
```

In this version, the reward function still prioritizes minimizing the distance to the goal, but the control cost weight has been increased to better balance the contribution of the control cost to the overall reward calculation. This should encourage the agent to not only move toward the goal but also to take into account the efficiency of its actions. Furthermore, since the reward should be a negative distance to the target, the sign of the total reward has been inverted. This allows far distances and high control costs to result in negative rewards, thus promoting the agent to reach its goal efficiently and quickly.

```

**LLM Response:**
```
Based on the results of the previous iteration and code review, the current reward function seems to be reasonably well-structured with a control cost term to penalize large actions and a term for the distance to the goal, which is in line with the task's requirements.  However, it could be improved to incentivize reaching the goal more effectively.

One possible issue with the current reward function is using squared distance to the goal as a part of reward. RL can have difficulty optimizing this especially at the beginning of the learning process where the agent is far from the goal. One solution is to use the linear distance to the goal instead of squared distance.

In addition, the control cost weight is set at 0.1. Depending on the scale of the environment (i.e., the typical distances involved), this might be too high and may lead the agent to prioritize minimizing its actions over reaching the goal. It could be beneficial to decrease this weight to allow the agent more freedom to perform the actions necessary to reach the goal.

Let's refactor the code based on these recommendations:

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
    """
    Custom reward function for the FetchReach robotics manipulation task. The reward is
    based on the euclidean distance to the goal and penalizes extensive action inputs

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : a dictionary or array like
        Current observation of the environment. If it's a dictionary, it needs to include an "observation" key.

    action : array like
        The agent's last action.

    done : Boolean
        Indicates whether the task is done or not.

    env : gym.Env
        The environment where the agent is interacting.

    Returns
    -------
    reward : float
        The reward for the current state, action, and next state.
    """
    # Fetch the unwrapped environment
    base_env = env.unwrapped

    # Extract the actual observation array if obs is a dictionary
    obs = obs.get('observation', obs) if isinstance(obs, dict) else obs

    # Constants
    ctrl_cost_weight = 0.01  # Decreasing the weight from 0.1 to 0.01 to give priority to reaching the goal.
    goal = base_env.goal

    # Compute the euclidean distance between the current position and the goal
    dist_to_goal = np.linalg.norm(goal - obs[:3])

    # Control cost (penalize extensive action inputs to encourage efficiency)
    ctrl_cost = ctrl_cost_weight * np.square(action).sum()

    # The reward is the inverse of the distance to the goal, but also considering the control cost
    reward = - dist_to_goal - ctrl_cost

    return reward
```
This new reward function gives more importance to reaching the goal and reduces the importance of action size. It should encourage the agent to learn to reach the goal more effectively. Remember always to train the agent with any changes made to the reward function, as the balance of the components of the reward function needs to suit the specific task and agent.
