**LLM Response:**

Based on the task description above, the primary goal of the manipulator is to reach the target quickly and accurately, thereby minimizing the distance to the target. As a result, our primary objective is to devise a reward function that encourages the system to move as closely as possible to the target. Here is a Python code that defines the said reward function. We will use the Euclidean distance to measure the closeness to the target.

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
    """
    Custom reward function for FetchReach task, which favors movements that decrease the Euclidean distance 
    to the target location.
    :param obs: observation from the environment
    :param action: action taken by the agent
    :param done: boolean flag indicating if the episode is finished
    :param env: the current environment
    :return: reward (float)
    """

    reward = 0.0  # Initialize reward

    # If the observation is a dictionary, get the actual observation array
    obs = obs.get('observation', obs)

    # Calculate Euclidean distance from current position to goal
    distance_to_target = np.linalg.norm(obs['achieved_goal'] - env.unwrapped.goal)

    # If episode is done and distance to target is less than a small threshold, add a bonus reward
    if done and distance_to_target < 0.01:
        reward += 100.0

    # Penalty for distance to target, the farther the distance, the higher the penalty
    reward -= 10.0 * distance_to_target

    return reward
```

The function above is just an initial idea about creating a reward function based on what the task described. 
The reward function gives a large positive reward (+100) when the task is done, and the Euclidean distance from the end effector of the manipulator to the target position is less than a specific value (0.01 in this case). For all the remaining states, the agent receives a penalty of 10 times the Euclidean distance to the target, causing the agent to get less reward the farther it is from the target.

This reward function should drive the manipulator to always try to minimize the distance to the target to maximize the reward.

Remember, reward engineering is a critical step in reinforcement learning, and finding the best reward function may require several iterations of trying and testing different reward functions.

Please carefully analyze the following policy feedback and reward function components. Based on this analysis, provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task.

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
(1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function. (Note: Success rate info might not be explicitly available, use Average Evaluation Reward as a proxy).
(2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout (Note: Component-wise breakdown is not provided, infer from code structure and overall results), then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider:
    (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter,
    (b) Re-writing the reward component, or
    (c) Discarding the reward component.
(3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range.

Please analyze the existing reward function code in the suggested manner above first, considering the provided results (Average Eval Reward, Final Training Reward, Error messages if any). Then write the new reward function code.

The reward function must have the signature:
    def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
Use only NumPy and standard Python, and access the target position using env.unwrapped.goal.

**LLM Response:**

Sure, here is the Python code representing the custom reward function for the task described above. 

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
    """
    Custom reward function for the FetchReach task. 

    Args:
    obs: dict. Dictionary of observation data received from the environment.
    action: ndarray. Represents the action taken by the agent. For FetchReach task, the action is an array, which corresponds to the desired change in position for the robotic arm.
    done: bool. Flag indicating whether the episode has terminated (True) or not (False).
    env: Object. The environment object, which allows access to additional environment-level properties and methods.

    Returns:
    float. The calculated reward value, which is a singular float value.

    [Coding Notes]
    obs usually contains: 
      - agent's observation of the current environment state. 
      - This includes: position of the gripper, position of the target.
    env.unwrapped.goal gives position of the goal in the environment

    """
    # Access the base environment, avoiding any wrappers
    env = env.unwrapped

    # Check if the observation is a dictionary. If so, extract the 'observation' key
    obs = obs.get('observation', obs)

    # Compute the Euclidean distance between current position and target position
    current_position = obs['observation']  # Current position of the robotic arm
    goal_position = env.goal  # Goal position (target)
    distance = np.linalg.norm(goal_position - current_position)

    # Reward should be negative distance to the target, plus additional bonus for reaching the target 
    if done and distance < 0.05:  # If episode is done and the arm is less than 5cm away from the target position

    else:
        reward = -distance  # Reward is negative value of distance

    return reward
```

An advantage of this reward function is that the reward is a continuous function of the agent's progress towards the goal. This property can help stable learning. The additional reward provided when the task is successfully completed gives a positive reinforcement to the agent, acting as a strong signal that it needs to learn to repeat such behaviors.

This Python function uses standard computations (e.g., Euclidean distance) to evaluate task performance. It has a structure that allows for easy modification or extension.

**LLM Response:**

Looking at the current reward function, the agent gets a negative reward proportional to the distance to the goal and an infinite negative reward when the episode terminates without achieving the goal. This might discourage trials and discourage the agent from experimenting with different strategies to reach the goal.

Therefore, instead of assigning a -np.inf reward upon termination, we can assign a large negative reward such that the agent is encouraged to try until the last step even if it hasn't reached the goal yet. Moreover, we can provide a substantial positive reward once the agent successfully reaches the goal. 

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
    """
    Custom reward function for a FetchReach task.
    
    This function computes a reward based on the distance between
    the end effector of the robotic arm and the target location. 
    The closer the end effector to the target, the higher the reward. 
    A significant positive reward is provided when the end effector reaches the target.
    A significant negative reward is given if the episode ends without achieving the goal,
    but less than before to avoid discouraging exploration.
    
    Args:
        obs (dict): observation dictionary containing 'observation', 'achieved_goal', and 'desired_goal'
        action (numpy.ndarray): action taken by the agent
        done (bool): whether the episode has terminated
        env (gym.Env): gym Environment object
    
    Returns:
        float: reward value
    """
    # Extract the goal from the environment
    goal = env.unwrapped.goal
    
    # Extract the relevant observation array
    obs = obs.get('observation', obs)
    
    # FetchReach observations include 
    #   - the position of the gripper
    #   - the position of the target
    # Here we consider only the 3D position of the gripper and the target, 
    # and ignore other parts such as velocities which aren't necessary for the reward calculation.
    gripper_pos = obs[:3]
    target_pos = goal if goal is not None else obs[3:6]
    
    # Compute the distance between the gripper and the target
    distance = np.linalg.norm(gripper_pos - target_pos)
    
    # Reward is negative distance to encourage getting closer to the target
    reward = -distance
    
    # If episode finished, assign different rewards based on whether the goal is achieved
    if done:
        # If the goal is achieved, provide a significant positive reward
        if np.allclose(gripper_pos, target_pos, atol=0.05):   # if gripper and goal are reasonably close
            reward = 100.0
        # If the goal is not reached, provide a significant negative reward, but less than infinity
        else:
            reward = -100.0

    return reward
```
In the function above, the agent is now motivated by a significantly positive reward to achieve the goal thereby minimizing discouragement.
Also, there's an added condition check to determine if the gripper position and target position are reasonably close to consider the goal to be accomplished. This reduces the hyper-sensitivity of having to be exactly at the goal location causing infinite negative reward to be imposed otherwise. This would tend to bring more stability in agent learning.

Please carefully analyze the following policy feedback and reward function components. Based on this analysis, provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task.

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
(1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function. (Note: Success rate info might not be explicitly available, use Average Evaluation Reward as a proxy).
(2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout (Note: Component-wise breakdown is not provided, infer from code structure and overall results), then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider:
    (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter,
    (b) Re-writing the reward component, or
    (c) Discarding the reward component.
(3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range.

Please analyze the existing reward function code in the suggested manner above first, considering the provided results (Average Eval Reward, Final Training Reward, Error messages if any). Then write the new reward function code.

The reward function must have the signature:
    def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
Use only NumPy and standard Python, and access the target position using env.unwrapped.goal.
