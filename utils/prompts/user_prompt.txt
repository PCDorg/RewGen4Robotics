Task: AntMaze - Teach the quadruped robot (ant) to walk to a target position efficiently.

Generate a reward function that:
- Encourages the ant to move toward the target by using both its position and velocity information.
- Penalizes excessive or inefficient joint movements based on the torques (actions) applied.
- Provides a large bonus if the ant reaches the goal, and a penalty if it finishes before reaching the goal.
- Uses the environment's goal position correctly by accessing it as `env.unwrapped.goal`.

Ensure your code uses only NumPy and standard Python.
