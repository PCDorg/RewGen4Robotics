  env_name: Go1MujocoCustom-v0
  task: Make the Go1 robot walk forward at a desired velocity.
  task_description: The agent controls a Unitree Go1 quadruped robot simulated in
    MuJoCo. The goal is to track a desired linear (forward) and angular velocity.
    Observations include joint positions/velocities, base linear/angular velocities,
    projected gravity vector, desired velocity, and previous actions. Actions are
    joint torques.
