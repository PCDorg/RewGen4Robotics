    of four main body parts - a single torso at the top (with the two legs splitting
    after the torso), two thighs in the middle below the torso, two legs in the bottom
    below the thighs, and two feet attached to the legs on which the entire body rests.
    The goal is to make coordinate both sets of feet, legs, and thighs to move in
