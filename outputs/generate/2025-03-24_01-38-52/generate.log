[2025-03-24 01:38:52,587][root][INFO] - Task description: The walker is a two-dimensional two-legged figure that consist of four main body parts - a single torso at the top (with the two legs splitting after the torso), two thighs in the middle below the torso, two legs in the bottom below the thighs, and two feet attached to the legs on which the entire body rests. The goal is to make coordinate both sets of feet, legs, and thighs to move in the forward (right) direction by applying torques on the six hinges connecting the six body parts.

The reward will be composed of several components:\n\n1. **Forward Velocity Reward**: Encourage forward movement by rewarding positive velocity along the x-axis.\n2. **Control Cost**: Penalize excessive torque usage to encourage energy efficiency.\n3. **Alive Bonus**: A constant reward for keeping the walker upright, promoting stability.\n\nLet\'s implement this reward function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\ndef compute_reward(\n    self,\n    qpos: torch.Tensor,\n    qvel: torch.Tensor\n) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Parameters\n    velocity_temperature = 0.1\n    control_temperature = 0.01\n    alive_bonus = 1.0\n\n    # Extract forward velocity\n    forward_velocity = qvel[0]  # The first element of qvel represents x-velocity\n\n    # Forward velocity reward\n    forward_reward = forward_velocity\n    forward_reward_transformed = torch.exp(forward_reward / velocity_temperature)\n\n    # Control cost\n    control_cost = torch.sum(qvel ** 2)\n    control_cost_transformed = torch.exp(-control_cost / control_temperature)\n\n    # Alive bonus\n    alive_reward = torch.tensor(alive_bonus, device=qpos.device)\n\n    # Total reward\n    total_reward = forward_reward_transformed + control_cost_transformed + alive_reward\n\n    # Construct reward dictionary\n    reward_dict = {\n        "forward_reward": forward_reward_transformed,\n        "control_cost": control_cost_transformed,\n        "alive_bonus": alive_reward\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_dict\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Forward Velocity Reward**: We apply a transformation to the forward velocity to encourage the walker to move forward efficiently.\n- **Control Cost**: We penalize large torques (represented by high velocity values) to ensure energy-efficient motion. This penalty is transformed to ensure better scaling.\n- **Alive Bonus**: It\'s a simple constant reward given if the walker remains upright, promoting stability. \n\nBy combining these components, the agent should learn to move forward effectively while using minimal energy and maintaining balance.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, annotations=[]))
