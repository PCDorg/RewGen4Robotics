Task Goal: Navigate the Ant robot through a maze to reach a target.
Environment Name: AntMazeCustom-v0
Full Task Description:
The agent controls a quadrupedal robot (Ant) in a maze-like environment. The goal is to navigate from a starting position to a target position within the maze. Observations likely include joint positions, velocities, contact forces, and potentially lidar or position information. Actions are joint torques or target joint positions.

Detailed Environment Configuration:
- env_name: AntMazeCustom-v0
- task: Navigate the Ant robot through a maze to reach a target.
- task_description: The agent controls a quadrupedal robot (Ant) in a maze-like environment. The goal is to navigate from a starting position to a target position within the maze. Observations likely include joint positions, velocities, contact forces, and potentially lidar or position information. Actions are joint torques or target joint positions.
- timestamps: 2000000

Observation Space Details:
Observation space structure not available.

Feedback from Previous Iterations / Analysis:
This is the first iteration. Please generate an initial reward function based on the task description and environment details provided.

[System Retry Feedback]: The previous response did not contain a valid Python code block. Please ensure the reward function code is clearly marked within ```python ... ``` tags and follows the required signature `def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):`. Use only numpy and standard python.


Instructions:
Based on the task, environment configuration, observation space, and feedback, generate an improved Python reward function. 
The function must have the signature: `def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):`

Environment-Specific Notes:
- **Go1 Env:** The target is a velocity vector. Access it using `env.desired_velocity`. Do NOT use `env.goal`.
- **FetchReach Env:** The target is a position. Access the desired goal position using `env.unwrapped.goal`.
- **AntMaze Env:** Refer to environment documentation or observation details for goal/target information.

IMPORTANT: `obs` is a dictionary for Go1 and FetchReach. Access its components ONLY using the string keys listed in Observation Space Details (e.g., `obs['linear_velocity']`). DO NOT use integer indices like `obs[0]` or `obs[-3]`.

Use only NumPy (`import numpy as np`) and standard Python libraries.
Ensure the code is enclosed in a single Python code block (```python ... ```).

```

**LLM Response:**
```
Here is the Python code for the reward function:

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
    """
    Reward function for AntMazeCustom-v0 environment.
    
    Args:
    obs (dict): Current observation from the environment.
    action (array-like): Action taken by the agent.
    done (bool): Whether the episode is terminated.
    env: Environment object.
    
    Returns:
    float: Reward value for the current state and action.
    """
    
    # Initialize the reward value
    reward = 0
    
    # Get the current position of the ant
    position = obs['body_pos']
    
    # Calculate the Euclidean distance from the current position to the target position
    target_position = env.unwrapped.target_pos
    distance = np.linalg.norm(target_position - position)
    
    # If the episode is not terminated, reward the agent for moving towards the target
    if not done:
        # Reward the agent for reducing the distance to the target
        reward -= distance
        
    # If the episode is terminated
    if done:
        # Reward the agent for reaching the target
        if distance < 0.1:  # Consider the target reached if within 0.1 units from the target
            reward += 10
        elif distance < 0.3:  # Consider the target reached if within 0.3 units from the target
            reward += 5
        else:
            # If the agent did not reach the target, penalize it for not trying hard enough
            reward -= 10
    
    # Ensure the reward is between -1 and 1 to improve learning stability
    reward = np.clip(reward, -1, 1)
    
    # Return the calculated reward
    return reward
```

This reward function is designed to balance the exploration and exploitation of the ant in the maze. It encourages the agent to move towards the target while avoiding collisions and getting stuck in corners. The reward is calculated based on the distance from the current position to the target position, and it is adjusted according to whether the episode is terminated or not.
```

Please carefully analyze the following policy feedback and reward function components. Based on this analysis, provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task.

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
(1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function. (Note: Success rate info might not be explicitly available, use Average Evaluation Reward as a proxy).
(2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout (Note: Component-wise breakdown is not provided, infer from code structure and overall results), then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider:
    (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter,
    (b) Re-writing the reward component, or
    (c) Discarding the reward component.
(3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range.

Please analyze the existing reward function code in the suggested manner above first, considering the provided results (Average Eval Reward, Final Training Reward, Error messages if any). Then write the new reward function code.

The reward function must have the signature:
    def custom_reward_function(obs, action, done, env):
Use only NumPy and standard Python, and access the target position using env.unwrapped.goal.

Below is the information from the previous iteration:

**Status:** Partial Success - Evaluation Failed
**Training Result:** Final Mean Training Reward (from TensorBoard `rollout/ep_rew_mean`): `N/A`
**Evaluation Result:** Failed to get an average reward (likely no episodes completed).

Review the reward function (below) for issues that might prevent episode completion during evaluation (e.g., infinite loops, unreachable goals).
