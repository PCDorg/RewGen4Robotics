  task: Navigate the Ant robot through a maze to reach a target.
  task_description: The agent controls a quadrupedal robot (Ant) in a maze-like environment.
    The goal is to navigate from a starting position to a target position within the
    maze. Observations likely include joint positions, velocities, contact forces,
    and potentially lidar or position information. Actions are joint torques or target
    joint positions.
